## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

We have created a bus booking system that books reservations and displays them using databases. We 
have implemented composition, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism and exceptions handling. The class 
diagram is as follows. The project includes a menu in which the person can view routes, book and see reservations. 
It also includes option for admin which can control the databases (route and reservations) individually and 
add/update/delete the routes that are visible to the customer.
